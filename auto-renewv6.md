1. Toggle Auto-Renew on and off by clicking this button.
2. Choose how often you want Rooof to check for renewable ads. We recommend that you set this at "Every 2 hours" to get the best use of this feature.
3. Choose how long after the original posting date you want your ads to be renewed. For example: If you select "30 days" then Rooof will stop renewing an ad once it is 30 days old.
