# Chrome Webstore
This page will show you how to access the Chrome Webstore. The Webstore has various apps and extentions for your Google Chrome browser.

Once you are in the Webstore, you can browse by category, features, or ratings. You can also search for apps using the search bar. When you find an app you want to download, click the blue "**Add to Chrome**" button. <br>

Note: You cannot search for the Rooof posting tool app - you must have a direct link.

When it has successfully downloaded, the button will change to green and say "**Added to Chrome**".<br>
