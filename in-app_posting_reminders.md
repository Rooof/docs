## In-App Posting Reminders

Rooof offers in-app reminders to post. These are especially helpful if you need to post a certain number of times each day.

Click the button to toggle between on and off.

Set the reminder frequency to how many times a day you need to post. The reminders will pop up in the bottom right corner of your screen. This setting also ensures that your ads are posted throughout the day, which cuts down on ghosting and flagging. Spreading out your posts also ensures that a wide variety of viewers are seeing your ads.
