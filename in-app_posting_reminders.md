##Over-Posting Protection
It is important to space out your posts throughout the day. If you post your ads too close together, they may be ghosted or flagged by Craigslist and be removed. Over-posting protection will help remind you to leave time between ads.

The "**Minimum time between ads**" will determine the amount of time after posting an ad that we will remind you not to over-post. We recommend setting this at least one hour between posts, depending on how many times you post each day.

When a over-posting protection pop-up appears, you are able to bypass the warning and post anyways.

Rooof offers in-app reminders to post. These are especially helpful if you need to post a certain number of times each day.

Click the button to toggle between on and off.

Set the reminder frequency to how many times a day you need to post. The reminders will pop up in the bottom right corner of your screen. This setting also ensures that your ads are posted throughout the day, which cuts down on ghosting and flagging. Spreading out your posts also ensures that a wide variety of viewers are seeing your ads.
