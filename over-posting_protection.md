# Over-Posting Protection
It is important to space out your posts throughout the day. If you post your ads too close together, they may be ghosted or flagged by Craigslist and be removed. Over-posting protection will help remind you to leave time between ads.

The "**Minimum time between ads**" will determine the amount of time after posting an ad that we will remind you not to over-post. We recommend setting this at least one hour between posts, depending on how many times you post each day.

When a over-posting protection pop-up appears, you are able to bypass the warning and post anyways.
