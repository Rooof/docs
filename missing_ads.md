# Phone Verification
This page will explain the phone verification process.

Once you hit "Publish" Craigslist may need you to confirm the ad through phone verification. This generally happens in the first month of using an account, but may happen past this point. If you publish an ad and it is not showing, check your email for a verification notification email.

If so, this is the page you will see after you click "Publish" on your ad.

1. Go to your email
2. Check for an email from Craigslist with the subject "POST/EDIT/DELETE"
   - If you do not see it, check your junk folder
