# Missing Ads
This page will explain what to do if you have published a Craigslist ad but it is not showing on Craigslist.

Sometimes once you hit "Publish" Craigslist need you to confirm the ad through email. This generally only happens in the first month of using an account, but may happen past this point.

If so, this is the page you will see after you click "Publish" on your ad.

1. Go to your email
2. Check for an email from Craigslist with the subject "POST/EDIT/DELETE"
   - If you do not see it, check your junk folder
3. Click the link in the email
