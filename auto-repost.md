# Auto-Repost
Craigslist has a set lifetime for an ad. The length of time an ad stays posted for depends on the region. Once an ad has been up for the set amount of time it will expire and be removed. Craigslist gives you the opportunity to repost your ad. The Rooof auto-repost function will repost your ads for you.

2. Choose how often you want Rooof to check for ads eligible for reposting. We recommend that you set this to "Every 2 hours"
3. Choose how long after the original posting date you want your ads to be reposted. For example: If you select "30 days" then Rooof will stop reposting an ad once it is 30 days old.
