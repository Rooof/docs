Click the "**Enabled/Disabled**" buttons to toggle the options. When a header is set to "**Disabled**" it will not be put in to the rotation of headers to be used. This option is helpful if you have a header that you use frequently, but not all the time.

Click the **pencil icon** next to a header to edit.

Click the **trash can **to the right of a header to completely delete the corresponding header.
