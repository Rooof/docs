# Craigslist Lifecycle
 A post on Craigslist follows a cycle:
<br>
- Drafted
- Published
- Renewed
- Expired
- Reposted
- Deleted
<br>
##Drafted
 When you have filled out the information for a new ad, it is a draft. In the "drafted" stage, only you are able to see the ad - the public cannot see the ad at this stage. When you are happy with the draft of your ad, click "Publish"
<br>
##Published
 In the "Published" stage, your ad is able to be viewed and searched for by the public. Visitors viewing your ad will be able to respond.
<br>
##Renewed
 Renewing an ad pushes your ad to the top of the search results. This helps your ad be near the top of all the postings. It also increases the likelihood that your ad will be viewed and receive responses.  Ads can be renewed approximately 48 hours after posting. If you have Rooof set to automatically renew your ads, the posting tool will check routinely to see what ads are able to be renewed.
<br>
##Expired
 An ad expires after a set amount of days from the original posting (usually 30 days). Once an ad has expired, you can choose to repost the ad. If you have Rooof set to automatically repost your ads, the posting tool will check routinely for ads that can be re-posted.
 <br>
 ##Reposted
 An ad is in the reposted stage when it has expired and been reposted.
 <br>
 ##Deleted
 When an ad is completely removed from Craigslist, it is in the deleted stage. This happens when a user chooses to delete an ad before the expiry, or if an ad has expired and not renewed.
