# Craigslist Problems

 Common Craigslist problems are being "flagged" or "deleted". This is when your ad is removed from the site before the expiration due to a Craigslist robot removing it, or from a user flagging it as "prohibited". Craigslist does not disclose the reason for removal - this page will describe common reasons for an ad being flagged.

 ##Causes of Flagging
This may occur for any of the following reasons:
- Posting identical content within 48 hours
- Posting content in multiple cities (even if the content is different)
- Posting any two ads within the same hour (time period varies by city)
- Reusing the same title for multiple ads
- Posting too many ads in a single day (limit varies per city)
- Posting from a foreign country, state, or city (e.g. using foreign employees or posting while you are on vacation)
- Using words that hint of scam, such as "free", "credit card", "dating", etc.
- Using photos that are irrelevant to the ad
- Posting an ad with no photos
- Writing an ad that is "too commercial" - Craigslist doesn't define this, but to avoid this you can try:
     - Using the Craigslist email relay
     - Avoid using logos in the photos
     - Start the ad with facts, instead of starting with romantic or poetic writing about the property

##User Flagging
Although we may not agree with their reasons, Craigslist viewers have reported flagging ads for the following reasons:
- Disgruntled tenant, former employee, or competitor
- Overusing scammy words (such as "free" or "deal" making the ad seem too good to be true
- Missing phone number or email address
- Too many large paragraphs in an ad
- Not enough factual or critical information, or this information is hard to find
- Ad looks like a generic template
- Ad is for a whole property instead of a specific unit
- Looks like a big company (even if you are a big company)
- Use of HTML, such as bold or underlined text (even though this is allowed)
- Not allowing email responses
