# Best Practices

##Best Practice for Posting
Following these guidelines will help your posts stand out, and also avoid being flagged:
- Only use your account to post ads in one city/region
- Include a phone number in the body of every ad
- Write a unique title for every post
- Write different content in the main body of your ads
- Leave at least one hour between every post (more time is better)
- Leave at least one hour between every renew (more time is better)
- Renewing ads is better than posting new ads
- Use the CL email relay (don't hide your email address)
- Include 2-9 photos (rotate the order of the photos)
