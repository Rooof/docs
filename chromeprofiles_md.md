# Using Multiple Chrome Profiles

If you use the same computer to post for multiple properties, you should have a Craigslist account for each property. This page will show you how to switch between the two accounts by using Chrome profiles.

Follow these instructions:
1. Open the Google Chrome browser
2. If you are logged in to Chrome, click the button with your name in the top right corner

If you are not logged in, click the icon in this place and enter your credentials.

3. Click the "Switch Person" button

4. If there is already another profile logged in to Chrome, it will show beside yours. If not, then click "Add Account" at the bottom of the page. This will allow you to create a new profile to use in Chrome.
