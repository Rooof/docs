# Location on Map
This page will show the mapping features of Craigslist, and how Rooof interacts with these features.

When you post an ad to Craigslist, the property location is placed on a map. This helps potential residents see what area the property is in within the city.<br>

A pin is placed on your map based on the information that Rooof pulls from your property website.

**There are two ways to change the locations in your posting:**
##Craigslist "Edit Location"
1. Edit the draft posting. Once Rooof gives you the unpublished draft version of your ad, click "**Edit Location**".
